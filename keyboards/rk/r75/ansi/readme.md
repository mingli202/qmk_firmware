To reset the board into bootloader mode, do one of the following:

* Hold the Reset switch mounted under the space bar while connecting the USB cable
* Hold the Escape key while connecting the USB cable (also erases persistent settings)
* Fn+R_Shift+Esc will reset the board to bootloader mode if you have flashed the default QMK keymap
* if using my custom firmware, reset is hidden under a layer and a triple tap.
